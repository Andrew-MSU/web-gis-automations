# Data Types in GIS

This notebook is designed to teach students about the importance and usage of data types in GIS using Python. It introduces key data types and demonstrates their application in GIS workflows.

## Notebook Contents
- **Overview of Data Types**: Explanation of string, integer, float, boolean, and date types with examples.
- **Practical Exercises**: Interactive code snippets to explore data types.
- **Mapping Example**: Demonstrates creating a spatial dataset and visualizing it in ArcGIS Online.

## Prerequisites
- Jupyter Notebook environment or ArcGIS Online Notebooks
- ArcGIS Online credentials (for the mapping example)
- Basic knowledge of Python

## How to Use

### In Jupyter Notebook
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `data-types-in-gis` folder.
