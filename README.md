# GIS Contributions Repository

Welcome to the GIS Contributions repository! This repository is designed to showcase and share web maps, applications, and Python notebooks developed for Geographic Information Systems (GIS) projects. As an academic, I aim to provide structured, reproducible, and easily accessible resources for the GIS community, researchers, and students.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main categories:

### 1. Web Maps and Apps

This section contains web maps and applications created using ArcGIS Pro and ArcGIS Online. Each project includes:

- A detailed README with project context, methodology, and usage instructions.
- Metadata files describing the layers and configuration used.
- Screenshots or links to the live web maps or apps.

**Location**: `web-maps-and-apps/`

### 2. Python Notebooks

This section contains Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate GIS operations, analyses, and workflows. Each notebook is:

- Documented with clear explanations of steps and methodology.
- Accompanied by sample data (when feasible) or instructions to obtain necessary datasets.

**Location**: `python-notebooks/`
